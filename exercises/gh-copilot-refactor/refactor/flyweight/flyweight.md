# Flyweight Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight) pattern with the help of copilot. The file `flyweight.*` contains a class that needs to be refactored to use the flyweight pattern.

## Exercise Description

The flyweight pattern is a design pattern that uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. In this exercise, you will refactor a class in the `flyweight.*` file to use the flyweight pattern.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that could benefit from the flyweight pattern.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to use the flyweight pattern.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Implement the Flyweight Pattern:** Refactor the provided code to use the flyweight pattern.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
