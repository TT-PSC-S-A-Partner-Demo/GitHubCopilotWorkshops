# Pipeline Pattern Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [pipeline](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/pipeline/#programmatic-example-of-pipeline-pattern-in-java) pattern with the help of copilot. The file `pipeline.*` contains a class that needs to be refactored to use the pipeline pattern.

## Exercise Description

The pipeline pattern is a design pattern that allows a sequence of processing elements, arranged so that the output of one element is the input of the next. It is used when you want to perform a sequence of operations on a collection of items, where the output of one operation is the input for the next. In this exercise, you will refactor a class in the `pipeline.*` file to use the pipeline pattern.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that could benefit from the pipeline pattern.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to use the pipeline pattern.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Implement the Pipeline Pattern:** Refactor the provided code to use the pipeline pattern.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
