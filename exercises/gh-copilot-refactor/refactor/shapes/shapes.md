# Shapes Exercise

## Objective

In this exercise, you will work with a provided codebase that is currently difficult to read and understand. Your task is to refactor this code to improve its readability and maintainability.

## Exercise Description

Readability is a crucial aspect of any codebase. It allows developers to understand the code, which makes it easier to maintain and extend. In this exercise, you will be given a codebase that is hard to read and understand. Your task is to refactor this code to improve its readability.

## Provided Code

The code provided to you is a complex and hard-to-read implementation of different shapes and their properties. Your task is to refactor this code to improve its readability and maintainability.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that are particularly hard to understand or could be simplified.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to improve readability. This could involve renaming variables and functions, breaking down complex functions into smaller ones, adding comments, or reorganizing the code structure.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Improve Readability:** Refactor the provided code to make it easier to read and understand.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
