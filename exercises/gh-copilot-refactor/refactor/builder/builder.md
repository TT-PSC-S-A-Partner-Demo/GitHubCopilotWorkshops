# Builder Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) pattern with the help of copilot. The file `builder.*` contains a class that needs to be refactored to use the builder pattern.

## Exercise Description

The builder pattern is a design pattern that provides a flexible solution to object creation problems. It is used when the construction of an object is complex and should be separated from its representation. In this exercise, you will refactor a class in the `builder.*` file to use the builder pattern.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that could benefit from the builder pattern.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to use the builder pattern.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Implement the Builder Pattern:** Refactor the provided code to use the builder pattern.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
