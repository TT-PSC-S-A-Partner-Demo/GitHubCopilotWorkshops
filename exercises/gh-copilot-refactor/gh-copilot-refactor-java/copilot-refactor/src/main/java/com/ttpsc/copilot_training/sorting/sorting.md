# Merge Sort Exercise

> **ðŸ“š Solution Available**: A complete solution with detailed explanation is available in [SOLUTIONS.md](../../../../../SOLUTIONS.md#sorting-exercise---merge-sort-bug-fix)

## Objective

In this exercise, you will work with an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm. The provided code contains a deliberate mistake in the merging function that affects the sorting of the array. Your tasks are to identify and fix the mistake using GitHub Copilot and to write additional tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Exercise Description

Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm used to sort arrays or lists. The algorithm involves recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element or is empty. The sorted subarrays are then merged together to form a single sorted array.

## Provided Code

The code provided to you implements Merge Sort but includes a mistake. This mistake prevents the algorithm from correctly sorting the input array.

## Tasks

1. **Identify and Fix the Mistake:**
    - Use GitHub Copilot to analyze the provided Merge Sort implementation and identify the mistake. 

2. **Write Additional Tests:**
    - Using GitHub Copilot, write additional tests to verify that the Merge Sort implementation works correctly with various input cases.
       

## Goals

- **Fix the Implementation:** Correct the identified mistake in the merging function so that the Merge Sort algorithm sorts arrays or lists as expected.
- **Validate the Implementation:** Write and run comprehensive tests to ensure that the Merge Sort algorithm handles various cases correctly, including edge cases.
