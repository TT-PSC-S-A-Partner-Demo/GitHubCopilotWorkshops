# Template Pattern Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [template](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method) pattern with the help of copilot. The file `template.*` contains a class that needs to be refactored to use the template pattern.

## Exercise Description

The template pattern is a design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. In this exercise, you will refactor a class in the `template.*` file to use the template pattern.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that could benefit from the template pattern.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to use the template pattern.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Implement the Template Pattern:** Refactor the provided code to use the template pattern.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
