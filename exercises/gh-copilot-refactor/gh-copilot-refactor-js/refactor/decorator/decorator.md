# Decorator Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to implement the [decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) pattern with the help of copilot. The file `decorator.*` contains a class that needs to be refactored to use the decorator pattern.

## Exercise Description

The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In this exercise, you will refactor a class in the `decorator.*` file to use the decorator pattern.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Current Implementation:**
    - Spend some time understanding the current implementation and how it works.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
    - Identify parts of the code that could benefit from the decorator pattern.

3. **Refactor the Code:**
    - Refactor the identified parts of the code to use the decorator pattern.

4. **Test the Refactored Code:**
    - Ensure that the refactored code still works as expected by running any provided tests.

## Goals

- **Implement the Decorator Pattern:** Refactor the provided code to use the decorator pattern.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the refactored code still performs the same tasks as the original code.
