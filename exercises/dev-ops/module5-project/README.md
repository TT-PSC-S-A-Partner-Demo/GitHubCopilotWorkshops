# Module 5: Final Project - Practical Application

## Introduction
This final module brings together all the skills you've learned throughout the workshop in a comprehensive, real-world project. You'll apply GitHub Copilot to solve complex DevOps challenges that integrate infrastructure as code, scripting, debugging, and customization.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply GitHub Copilot skills to solve real-world DevOps challenges
- Integrate multiple technologies and approaches in a cohesive solution
- Develop critical thinking about when and how to effectively use AI assistance
- Create a portfolio-worthy project demonstrating Copilot mastery

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Modules 1-4
- Familiarity with all tools and technologies covered in previous modules
- A GitHub repository to store your project

## Project Options
Choose one of the following projects based on your interests and technical background:

### Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Migration (Intermediate)

#### Description
Migrate a CI/CD pipeline from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions using GitHub Copilot.

#### Tasks
1. Analyze an existing Azure DevOps pipeline configuration
2. Use Copilot to translate it to equivalent GitHub Actions workflows
3. Implement proper security scanning and testing in the workflow
4. Add deployment stages for multiple environments
5. Create documentation explaining the migration process

### Project 2: Microservices Infrastructure (Advanced)

#### Description
Design and implement the complete infrastructure for a microservices application using GitHub Copilot.

#### Tasks
1. Create Terraform modules for cloud infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups)
2. Develop Kubernetes manifests for microservices deployment
3. Implement service mesh for inter-service communication
4. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
5. Create automation scripts for maintenance tasks
6. Develop documentation and diagrams

#### Deliverables
- Complete IaC repository with Terraform configurations and Kubernetes manifests
- Deployment and maintenance scripts
- Documentation including architecture diagrams
- Demonstration of how Copilot assisted in development

### Project 3: DevSecOps Implementation (Advanced)

#### Description
Implement a comprehensive DevSecOps solution for an application, with security integrated at every stage of the pipeline.

#### Tasks
1. Create a CI/CD pipeline with security scanning at each stage
2. Implement Infrastructure as Code with security best practices
3. Develop scripts for vulnerability management and compliance checking
4. Create automated remediation for common security issues
5. Set up security monitoring and alerting

### Project 4: Self-Service Developer Platform (Expert)

#### Description
Create a self-service platform for developers to provision standardized environments and resources.

#### Tasks
1. Develop a service catalog with standardized environment templates
2. Create automation for environment provisioning
3. Implement governance and compliance checks
4. Build monitoring and cost management features
5. Develop a simple UI or CLI for developers to request resources

## Project Structure Guidelines

Regardless of which project you choose, your solution should include:

1. **Documentation**
   - Project overview and architecture
   - Setup and usage instructions
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - Lessons learned using GitHub Copilot

2. **Code Organization**
   - Well-structured repositories with clear organization
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Documentation in code using comments

3. **DevOps Best Practices**
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated testing
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Security considerations
   - Monitoring and observability

4. **Copilot Integration**
   - Custom instructions file for your repository
   - Examples of how Copilot was used in development
   - Reflection on what worked well and what didn't

## Evaluation Criteria

Your final project will be evaluated based on:

1. **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, documented, and maintainable?
3. **DevOps Practices**: Does it follow industry best practices?
4. **Creativity**: Are there innovative solutions to problems?
5. **Copilot Usage**: How effectively was GitHub Copilot leveraged?
6. **Documentation**: Is the project well-documented?

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project
2. Include a detailed README.md file
3. Document your use of GitHub Copilot throughout the project
4. Be prepared to present your project and explain your design decisions
