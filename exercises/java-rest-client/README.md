# java copilot_hackaton
The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use GitHub Copilot, using an exercise that consist of building a REST API using Spring Boot.

## Use Case: 
We have created a Spring Boot project with some files already created, you can find the project in the folder **exercisefiles/springboot**. 
Let's start copiloting!!!

## Pre-requisite:

### Environment preparation:
1.	Log-in to your lab virtual machine using credentials provided.
2.	Open indellij idea
3.	Get project from VCS (Click option install git) https://github.com/copworkshop/java_hackaton.git. Login via github( in case of error login via token)
4. Install Java sdk suggested by IntelliJ Idea  (Oracle OpenJDK 20)
5. Go to File/Settings  and then select Plugins. Install GH copilot plugin, restart IDE and login

## Exercises

### 1. Create the code to handle a simple GET request

Move to the 'DemoController.java' file and start writing the code to handle a simple GET request. In this first exercise, we have provided a comment that describes the code you need to generate. Enter GH plugin window (refresh) and choose best option.

There is already a unit test implemented for this exercise, you can run it using the command `mvn test` before and after to validate that the code generated by Copilot is correct.

Then, create a new unit test for the case when no key is provided in the request.

After every exercise, feel free to package and run your application to test it.

Package: `mvn package`

Run: `mvn spring-boot:run`

Test: `curl -v http://localhost:8080/hello?key=world`

### 2. Dates comparison

New operation under /diffdates that calculates the difference between two dates. The operation should receive two dates as parameter in format dd-MM-yyyy and return the difference in days. 

Additionally, create a unit test that validates the operation.

From now on, you will have to create the unit tests for every new operation. Wasn't it easy with Copilot? 

### 3. Validate the format of a spanish phone 

Validate the format of a spanish phone number (+34 prefix, then 9 digits, starting with 6, 7 or 9). The operation should receive a phone number as parameter and return true if the format is correct, false otherwise. 

### 4. Validate the format of a spanish DNI

Validate the format of a spanish DNI (8 digits and 1 letter). The operation should receive a DNI as parameter and return true if the format is correct, false otherwise. 

### 5. From color name to hexadecimal code

Based on existing colors.json file under resources, given the name of the color as path parameter, return the hexadecimal code. If the color is not found, return 404

Hint: Use TDD. Start by creating the unit test and then implement the code.

### 6. Jokes creator

Create a new operation that call the API https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random and return the joke.

### 7. URL parsing

Given a url as query parameter, parse it and return the protocol, host, port, path and query parameters. The response should be in Json format.

### 8. List files and folders 

List files and folders under a given path. The path should be a query parameter. The response should be in Json format.

### 9. Word counting

Given the path of a file and count the number of occurrence of a provided word. The path and the word should be query parameters. The response should be in Json format.

### 10. Zipping

Create a zip file with the content of a given folder. The path of the folder should be a query parameter.

### 11. Password Generator

Create an endpoint that generates secure passwords. Accept parameters for length, include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Use Copilot to suggest secure random generation methods.

### 12. Email Validation and Domain Extraction

Validate email addresses using regex patterns and extract the domain. Return both validation status and domain information in JSON format.

### 13. JWT Token Operations

Create endpoints to generate and validate JWT tokens. Use Copilot to implement secure token generation with proper claims and expiration handling.

### 14. File Encryption/Decryption

Implement basic file encryption and decryption using AES. Accept file path and password as parameters. Use Copilot to suggest secure crypto implementations.

### 15. Database CRUD Operations

Create a simple entity (e.g., User) with JPA annotations and implement full CRUD operations. Use Copilot to generate repository methods and service layer.

### 16. API Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting for your endpoints using annotations. Use Copilot to suggest rate limiting strategies and implementation patterns.

### 17. Data Validation with Custom Annotations

Create custom validation annotations for business rules (e.g., valid IBAN, credit card numbers). Use Copilot to generate validation logic.

### 18. Caching Implementation

Add caching to expensive operations using Spring Cache. Use Copilot to suggest appropriate caching strategies and annotations.

### 19. Error Handling and Global Exception Handler

Implement a global exception handler with custom error responses. Use Copilot to create comprehensive error handling patterns.

### 20. Async Processing

Create endpoints that handle long-running operations asynchronously. Use Copilot to implement proper async patterns with CompletableFuture.

### 21. Health Check Endpoints

Implement custom health check endpoints that verify database connectivity, external service availability, and system resources.

### 22. API Documentation with OpenAPI

Use Copilot to generate OpenAPI annotations and documentation for all your endpoints. Create comprehensive API documentation.

### 23. Integration Testing

Create integration tests that test the full request-response cycle. Use Copilot to generate test scenarios and mock external dependencies.

### 24. Performance Monitoring

Add performance monitoring and metrics collection to your endpoints. Use Copilot to implement timing and performance tracking.

### 25. Security Implementation

Implement basic authentication and authorization. Use Copilot to create secure endpoints with proper security configurations.

## Bonus Challenges

### 26. Refactoring Exercise

Take one of your existing endpoints and ask Copilot to refactor it following SOLID principles and clean code practices.

### 27. Code Review Assistant

Use Copilot Chat to review your code and suggest improvements for security, performance, and maintainability.

### 28. Documentation Generation

Use Copilot to generate comprehensive README files, API documentation, and inline code comments for your project.

### 29. Testing Strategy

Ask Copilot to suggest and implement different testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and edge case testing.

### 30. Deployment Configuration

Use Copilot to generate Docker files, deployment scripts, and CI/CD pipeline configurations for your Spring Boot application.
